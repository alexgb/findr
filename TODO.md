  - working on server side session storage: maybe need a semipermanent storage mechanism
    - issue with saving friends as new users in memory
  - when loading app and no user information available then take user to MyInfo page and prompt to enter info
  - create a position model/store to hold position data
    - this store will be managed by map
  - on socket position information push friend to both friends store and positions store.
  - map can redraw based on position store changes
